  Abstract                 = {The review gives the general theory of an isotropic Fermi liquid constructed by L. D. Landau, and continued by the authors of the present article. The results of the theory are compared with the experimental data on the properties of liquid helium 3 at low temperatures. The contents of the review are set out in the following order. After a short introduction (§ 1), § 2 gives the basic premises of L. D. Landau's theory, and in particular the energy of excitations and the interaction function f are derived. § 3 gives the derivation from Galileo's principle of a relation which expresses the effective mass of the excitations in terms of the mass of the atoms and the zeroth harmonic of the function f . § 4 is devoted to the derivation of the specific heat of a Fermi liquid, and an expression for the magnetic susceptibility is deduced in § 5. The exchange interaction of the excitations plays a considerable role in this expression. § 6 gives the kinetic equation for the excitations and this is used to find expressions for the momentum and energy flux. The results of § 6 are applied in § 7 to the calculation of the coefficient of viscosity, and in § 8 the coefficient of thermal conductivity is found by an analogous method. § 9 is concerned with the problem of the velocity of sound. In particular, this section contains the result obtained by L. D. Landau concerning the possibility of propagating the so-called `zero sound' in a Fermi liquid at sufficiently low temperatures. § 10 considers the problem of dispersion and absorption of sound. § 11 deduces the average fluctuations of the distribution function and this result is used to calculate the scattering of light. An expression is given for the total intensity of scattered light, and the frequency and angular distributions are also given. The Appendix shows how the basic premises of the theory of a Fermi liquid can be derived from microscopic considerations. § A1 considers the properties of a rarefied Fermi gas. § A2 gives the microscopic basis of the energy spectrum of a Fermi liquid in the general case, and also gives a relation between the function f and the scattering amplitude of excitations.},

  Abstract                 = {Synchrotron laminography is combined with Talbot grating interferometry to address weakly absorbing specimens. Integrating both methods into one set-up provides a powerful x-ray diagnostical technique for multiple contrast screening of macroscopically large flat specimen and a subsequent non-destructive three-dimensional (3-D) inspection of regions of interest. The technique simultaneously yields the reconstruction of the 3-D absorption, phase, and the so-called dark-field contrast maps. We report on the theoretical and instrumental implementation of of this novel technique. Its broad application potential is exemplarily demonstrated for the field of cultural heritage, namely study of the historical Dead Sea parchment.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase-contrast tomography is a non-interferometric imaging technique for reconstructing the refractive index distribution of a weakly absorbing object from a set of tomographic projection measurements. In many practical situations, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image can be increased by minimizing the field of view (FOV) of the imaging system. When the object of interest is larger than the FOV, the measured projections are truncated and one is faced with a local tomography reconstruction problem. In this work, we analytically and numerically investigate the problem of reconstructing tomographic images from truncated phase-contrast projection data. A simple backprojection algorithm for reconstructing object discontinuities from truncated phase-contrast projection data is proposed and investigated that involves no explicit filtering of the projection data. We also investigate the use of the filtered backprojection algorithm and a local tomography reconstruction algorithm developed for absorption CT. These reconstruction algorithms are implemented and numerically investigated to corroborate our theoretical assertions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration, it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the application of a new optical microscopy method (quantitative phase-amplitude microscopy) to biological imaging is explored, and the issue of resolution and image quality is examined. The paper begins by presenting a theoretical analysis of the method using the optical transfer function formalism of Streibl (1985). The effect of coherence on the formation of the phase image is explored, and it is shown that the resolution of the method is not compromised over that of a conventional bright-field image. It is shown that the signal-to-noise ratio of the phase recovery, however, does depend on the degree of coherence in the illumination.Streibl (1985) notes that partially coherent image formation is a non-linear process because of the intermingling of amplitude and phase information. The work presented here shows that the quantitative phase-amplitude microscopy method acts to linearize the image formation process, and that the phase and amplitude information is properly described using a transfer function analysis. The theoretical conclusions are tested experimentally using an optical microscope and the theoretical deductions are confirmed.Samples for microscopy influence both the phase and amplitude of the light wave and it is demonstrated that the new phase recovery method can separate the amplitude and phase information, something not possible using traditional phase microscopy. In the case of a coherent wave, knowledge of the phase and amplitude constitutes complete information that can be used to emulate other forms of microscopy. This capacity is demonstrated by recovering the phase of a sample and using the data to emulate a differential interference contrast image.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an iterative reconstruction algorithm for discrete tomography, called discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART). DART can be applied if the scanned object is known to consist of only a few different compositions, each corresponding to a constant gray value in the reconstruction. Prior knowledge of the gray values for each of the compositions is exploited to steer the current reconstruction towards a reconstruction that contains only these gray values. Based on experiments with both simulated CT data and experimental μCT data, it is shown that DART is capable of computing more accurate reconstructions from a small number of projection images, or from a small angular range, than alternative methods. It is also shown that DART can deal effectively with noisy projection data and that the algorithm is robust with respect to errors in the estimation of the gray values.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-linear parabola method for wave function reconstruction in \{HRTEM\} is presented in detail. It consists of an iterative procedure in which the linear and non-linear contributions to \{HRTEM\} images of a defocus series are optimally separated which will allow to benefit from a fast linear reconstruction scheme in which the non-linear contribution is corrected for in a self-consistent way. The method has proven to be a fast and workable algorithm for quantitative wave function reconstruction with direct resolution improvement. Results are shown for wave function reconstruction on experimentally acquired defocus series for a 200 keV FEG-TEM with a point-to-point resolution of 0.24 nm. In the reconstructed wave functions the resolution could clearly be enhanced up to 0.14 nm. },

  Abstract                 = {Synopsis An expansion is given of the function u(x, y, z) that satisfies the scalar wave equation in the half-space z &gt; 0 and equals a given distribution u0(x, y) in the plane z = 0. If u0 is zero beyond a closed contour L in z = 0, u(x, y, z) splits into a so-called geometrical-optical part (which vanishes outside the cylinder passing through L and having generating lines parallel to the z-axis) and a diffraction part (determined by the values of u0 near L). Each part can be expanded into terms depending on u0(x, y) itself and on its iterative two-dimensional Laplace operators Δnu0 = (∂2/∂x2∂2/∂y2)n) u0(x, y). The expansions are in general asymptotic for small wave lengths; however, their exact validity can be proved for functions u0 that are polynomials inside the contour L. The terms of the diffraction part consist of contour integrals along L, the corresponding terms for the geometrical-optical part do not depend on any integration. The first few terms of the latter part are essential for defocusing effects and can be connected with the brightness-contrast existing in the plane z = 0. },

  Abstract                 = {Phase-contrast x-ray computed tomography (CT) is an emerging imaging technique that can be implemented at third-generation synchrotron radiation sources or by using a microfocus x-ray source. Promising results have recently been obtained in materials science and medicine. At the same time, the lack of a mathematical theory comparable with that of conventional CT limits the progress in this field. Such a theory is now suggested, establishing a fundamental relation between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast projection. A reconstruction algorithm is derived in the form of a filtered backprojection. The filter function is given in the space and spatial-frequency domains. The theory suggested enables one to quantitatively determine the refractive index of a weakly absorbing medium from x-ray intensity data measured in the near-field region. The results of computer simulations are discussed.},

A linear closed-form solution to the problem is presented. Two reconstruction formulas are derived using an original relation established between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast intensity data. The application of the formulas requires tomographic acquisition of two-dimensional intensity distributions in a single plane of the near field. The reconstruction algorithms can be implemented by using the fast Fourier transform. },

  Abstract                 = {As a polychromatic X-ray beam passes through matter, low energy photons are preferentially absorbed, and the (logarithmic) attenuation is no longer a linear function of absorber thickness. This leads to various artifacts in reconstructive tomography. If a water bag is used, the nonlinear attenuation in bone causes a distortion of the bone values and a spill-over inside the skull, or 'pseudo-cortex' artifact. If no water bag is used, there is an additional effect due to the varying thickness of soft tissue which causes a depression of interior values, or 'cupping'. Both artifacts can be remedied by additional prefiltering of the beam and by applying a linearization correction to the detector outputs. These effects have been studied by computer simulation.},

In particular, these techniques are commonly used to obtain images of a γ-emitter distribution after its administration in the human body. The reconstructed images are obtained given a set of their projections, acquired using rotating gamma cameras. A general overview of analytic and iterative methods of reconstruction in SPECT is presented with a special focus on filter backprojection (FBP), conjugate gradient, maximum likelihood expectation maximization, and maximum a posteriori expectation maximization algorithms. The FBP algorithm is faster than iterative algorithms, with the latter providing a framework for accurately modeling the emission and detection processes.},

In this work we present the characterisation of the scintillating \{LSO\} films in terms of optical and scintillation properties as well as spatial resolution performances. The obtained results are discussed and compared with the performances of the thin scintillating films commonly used in synchrotron-based micro-imaging applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Diffraction enhanced imaging is a new x-ray radiographic imaging modality using monochromatic x-rays from a synchrotron which produces images of thick absorbing objects that are almost completely free of scatter. They show dramatically improved contrast over standard imaging applied to the same phantom. The contrast is based not only on attenuation but also the refraction and diffraction properties of the sample. This imaging method may improve image quality for medical applications, industrial radiography for non-destructive testing and x-ray computed tomography.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase retrieval extracts quantitative phase information from x-ray propagation-based phase-contrast images. Notwithstanding inherent approximations, phase retrieval using a single sample-to-detector distance (SDD) is very attractive, because it imposes no setup complications or additional radiation dose compared to absorption-based imaging. Considering the phase-attenuation duality ($\epsilon$$=$$\delta$/$\beta$, where $\epsilon$ is constant), a simple absorption correction factor is proposed for the modified Bronnikov algorithm in x-ray propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PPCT). Moreover, a practical method for calculating the optimal $\epsilon$ value is proposed, which requires no prior knowledge of the sample. Tests performed on simulation and experimental data successfully distinguished different materials in a quasihomogeneous and weakly absorbing sample from a single SDD-PPCT data point.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase retrieval is a nonlinear technique used to recover the phase in the Fourier domain using intensity measurements at the image plane and additional constraints. We describe a method to solve the phase retrieval problem using linear iterations near the solution, which provides both analytical insight into phase retrieval and numerical results. The algorithm finds the maximum a posteriori estimate of the phase using prior information about the statistics of the noise and the phase, and it was found to converge well in practice. When phase retrieval is performed on data from subdivided apertures, there is a loss of information regarding the relative piston terms of the subapertures. This error is quantified. We find that there is a smaller wavefront error when estimating the phase from a full aperture rather than from a subdivided aperture. Using a combination of intensity measurements from full and subdivided apertures results in a small improvement at very high photon levels only. © 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

While images without a phase signal can be reconstructed very well, such mixed phase and absorption images give rise to severe artifacts in the reconstructed slices. A method is described that applies a correction to these mixed projections to remove the phase signal. These corrected images can then be processed using a standard filtered backprojection algorithm to obtain reconstructions with only few or no phase artifacts. This new method, which we call the Bronnikov-aided correction (BAC), can be used in a broad variety of applications and without much additional effort. It is tested on a biological and a pharmaceutical sample, and results are evaluated and discussed by comparing them with those of conventional reconstruction methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

  Abstract                 = {The double Fourier decomposition of the sinogram is obtained by first taking the Fourier transform of each parallel-ray projection and then calculating the coefficients of a Fourier series with respect to angle for each frequency component of the transformed projections. The values of these coefficients may be plotted on a two-dimensional map whose coordinates are spatial frequency w (continuous) and angular harmonic number n (discrete). For |w| large, the Fourier coefficients on the line n=kw of slope k through the origin of the coefficient space are found to depend strongly on the contributions to the projection data that, for each view, come from a certain distance to the detector plane, where the distance is a linear function of k. The values of these coefficients depend only weakly on contributions from other distances from the detector. The theoretical basis of this property is presented in this paper and a potential application to emission computerized tomography is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {During amphibian gastrulation, the embryo is transformed by the combined actions of several different tissues. Paradoxically, many of these morphogenetic processes can occur autonomously in tissue explants, yet the tissues in intact embryos must interact and be coordinated with one another in order to accomplish the major goals of gastrulation: closure of the blastopore to bring the endoderm and mesoderm fully inside the ectoderm, and generation of the archenteron. Here, we present high-resolution 3D digital datasets of frog gastrulae, and morphometrics that allow simultaneous assessment of the progress of convergent extension, blastopore closure and archenteron formation in a single embryo. To examine how the diverse morphogenetic engines work together to accomplish gastrulation, we combined these tools with time-lapse analysis of gastrulation, and examined both wild-type embryos and embryos in which gastrulation was disrupted by the manipulation of Dishevelled (Xdsh) signaling. Remarkably, although inhibition of Xdsh signaling disrupted both convergent extension and blastopore closure, mesendoderm internalization proceeded very effectively in these embryos. In addition, much of archenteron elongation was found to be independent of Xdsh signaling, especially during the second half of gastrulation. Finally, even in normal embryos, we found a surprising degree of dissociability between the various morphogenetic processes that occur during gastrulation. Together, these data highlight the central role of PCP signaling in governing distinct events of Xenopus gastrulation, and suggest that the loose relationship between morphogenetic processes may have facilitated the evolution of the wide variety of gastrulation mechanisms seen in different amphibian species.},

  Abstract                 = {This review of the development and current status of electron tomography deals mainly with the mathematical and algorithmic aspects. After a very brief description of the role of electron tomography in structural biology, we turn our attention to the derivation of the forward operator. Starting from the Schrödinger equation, the electron–specimen interaction is modelled as a diffraction tomography problem and the picture is completed by adding a description of the optical system of the transmission electron microscope. The first-order Born approximation enables one to explicitly express the intensity for any finite wavenumber in terms of the propagation operator acting on the specimen convolved with a point spread function, derived from the optics in the transmission electron microscope. Next, we focus on the difficulties that cause the reconstruction problem to be quite challenging. Special emphasis is put on explaining the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in the data combined with the incomplete data problems, which lead to severe ill-posedness. The next step is to derive the standard phase contrast model used in the electron tomography community. The above-mentioned expression for the intensity generalizes the standard phase contrast model which can be obtained by replacing the propagation operator by its high-energy limit, the x-ray transform, as the wavenumber tends to infinity. The importance of more carefully including the wave nature of the electron–specimen interaction is supported by performing an asymptotic analysis of the intensity as the wavenumber tends to infinity. Next we provide an overview of the various reconstruction methods that have been employed in electron tomography and we conclude by mentioning a number of open problems. Besides providing an introduction to electron tomography written in the 'language of inverse problems', the authors hope to raise interest among experts in integral geometry and regularization theory for the mathematical and algorithmic difficulties that are encountered in electron tomography.},

We used mid-infrared femtosecond pulses to transform one such stripe-ordered compound, nonsuperconducting La1.675Eu0.2Sr0.125CuO4, into a transient three-dimensional superconductor. The emergence of coherent interlayer transport was evidenced by the prompt appearance of a Josephson plasma resonance in the c-axis optical properties. An upper limit for the time scale needed to form the superconducting phase is estimated to be 1 to 2 picoseconds, which is significantly faster than expected. This places stringent new constraints on our understanding of stripe order and its relation to superconductivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The new technique of x-ray microtomography nondestructively generates three-dimensional maps of the x-ray attenuation coefficient inside small samples with approximately 1 percent accuracy and with resolution approaching 1 micrometer. Spatially resolved elemental maps can be produced with synchrotron x-ray sources by scanning samples at energies just above and below characteristic atomic absorption edges. The system consists of a high-resolution imaging x-ray detector and high-speed algorithms for tomographic image reconstruction. The design and operation of the microtomography device are described, and tomographic images that illustrate its performance with both synchrotron and laboratory x-ray sources are presented.},

Following excitation of quinacrine in a pH 7.2 buffer solution at 395 nm, the excited molecule ejects an electron into the surrounding aqueous solution. The quantum efficiency for solvated electron formation at this excitation wavelength is determined to be in the range of 0.20−0.40. These results provide a simple mechanism that accounts for the generation of superoxide (O2-) following UV excitation of quinacrine in aqueous solution.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of the resolution/sensitivity of computerized X-ray transmission tomography is examined as a function of the photon energy. The optimum condition, which minimizes the time to scan a section at a given resolution/sensitivity, is that μ = 2/D, where μ is the linear attenuation coefficient and D is the specimen diameter. This condition, which can be met by the proper choice of the photon energy, is especially sharp for samples smaller than a few millimeters. When the photon energy is optimal for a given sample size, the total incident photons per scan determines the resolution/sensitivity product in dimensionless terms, (w/D)3(σ/μ)2. The necessary fluences and the consequent radiation dose increase rapidly as the resolution decreases. Synchrotron light sources, with their tunable, monochromatic beams of high flux density, appear to be uniquely matched to the needs of computerized tomography of radiation-resistant samples studied at resolutions down to the micrometer level. },

  Abstract                 = {We report the implementation of a method which can yield the3D distribution of the phase (refractive index) of a weakly absorbing objectfrom a single tomographic data set. In order to reduce the residualabsorption artifact (due to the fact that only one data set is used) the originalalgorithm presented by A. V. Bronnikov is amended by adding in the filter afactor found by using a semi empirical approach. The quality of thereconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and furtherpostprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption ofconstant absorption. This one step approach allows keeping radiation doseto the minimum. Spatial resolution is comparable to the conventionalabsorption based technique. The performance of the method is validated byusing an established phase contrast technique.},

Many of the transplant-frogs from donors of all ages were entirely normal, and many of the abnormalities observed were not connected with the condition of the transplanted nuclei. Frogs derived from the nuclei of differentiating cells were more often abnormal than those derived from embryonic cells. Out of 27 frogs derived from nuclei of hatched tadpole gut cells, 7 were sterile. The results demonstrate that at least 30\% of blastula nuclei and at least 4\% of hatched tadpole gut-cell nuclei contain a complete range of the genetic information necessary for the formation and functioning of a normal adult individual.},

  Abstract                 = {An important problem in embryology is whether the differentiation of cells depends upon a stable restriction of the genetic information contained in their nuclei. The technique of nuclear transplantation has shown to what extent the nuclei of differentiating cells can promote the formation of different cell types (e.g. King \& Briggs, 1956; Gurdon, 1960c). Yet no experiments have so far been published on the transplantation of nuclei from fully differentiated normal cells. This is partly because it is difficult to obtain meaningful results from such experiments. The small amount of cytoplasm in differentiated cells renders their nuclei susceptible to damage through exposure to the saline medium, and this makes it difficult to assess the significance of the abnormalities resulting from their transplantation. It is, however, very desirable to know the developmental capacity of such nuclei, since any nuclear changes which are necessarily involved in cellular differentiation must have already taken place in cells of this kind.},

Here we develop a different method for the solution of this equation, which allows recovery of the phase in the case of nonuniform illumination. Though also based on the orthogonal series expansion, the new method does not require any separate boundary conditions and can be more easily adjusted for apertures of various shapes. The discussion is primarily for the case of a circular aperture and Zernike polynomials, but we also outline the solution for a rectangular aperture and Fourier harmonics. The latter example may have some substantial advantages, given the availability of the fast Fourier transform.},

In the present work the relationship between two popular linear phase retrieval methods based on the Transport of Intensity equation and the first Born approximation, respectively, is clarified using a unified theoretical approach. It is also shown that a new phase retrieval method combining the two techniques has a broader validity range, higher accuracy and stability compared to the same techniques used separately. The new method is tested on simulated images and is demonstrated to be efficient for phase retrieval in the “near-Fresnel” region. },

  Abstract                 = {A new technique is proposed for the recovery of optical phase from intensity information. The method is based on the decomposition of the transport-of-intensity equation into a series of Zernike polynomials. An explicit matrix formula is derived, expressing the Zernike coefficients of the phase as functions of the Zernike coefficients of the wave-front curvature inside the aperture and the Fourier coefficients of the wave-front boundary slopes. Analytical expressions are given, as well as a numerical example of the corresponding phase retrieval matrix. This work lays the basis for an effective algorithm for fast and accurate phase retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition-temperature (Tc) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram.},

Over 1 million expressed sequence tags validated the annotation. More than one-third of the genome consists of transposable elements, with unusually prevalent DNA transposons. Like that of other tetrapods, the genome of X. tropicalis contains gene deserts enriched for conserved noncoding elements. The genome exhibits substantial shared synteny with human and chicken over major parts of large chromosomes, broken by lineage-specific chromosome fusions and fissions, mainly in the mammalian lineage.},

  Abstract                 = {Image reconstruction from projections suffers from an inherent difficulty: there are different images that have identical projections in any finite number of directions. However, by identifying the type of image that is likely to occur in an application area, one can design algorithms that may be efficacious in that area even when the number of projections is small. One such approach uses total variation minimization. We report on an algorithm based on this approach, and show that sometimes it produces medically-desirable reconstructions in computerized tomography (CT) even from a small number of projections. However, we also demonstrate that such a reconstruction is not guaranteed to provide the medically-relevant information: when data are collected by an actual CT scanner for a small number of projections, the noise in such data may very well result in a tumor in the brain not being visible in the reconstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of X-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation X-ray facilities. Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nanometer resolution with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life- and materials-science applications of \{XDM\} are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available X-ray sources for material science. In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a statistical analysis based on the so-called “dose fractionation theorem” of Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by \{XDM\} with a given resolution. We find that the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental evidence to support this finding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we have assembled a number of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution that are not well covered otherwise. The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and “Rose-criterion” image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biological sample using \{XDM\} at a resolution of about 10 nm.},

  Abstract                 = {Large, living biological specimens present challenges to existing optical imaging techniques because of their absorptive and scattering properties. We developed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to generate multidimensional images of samples up to a few millimeters in size. The system combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imaging throughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capable of capturing transient biological phenomena. We used SPIM to visualize all muscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses green fluorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that SPIM can be applied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila melanogaster in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {We show in benchtop experiments that wave-front phase estimation by phase diversity can be significantly improved by simultaneous amplitude estimation. Processing speed, which will be important for real-time wave-front control applications, can be enhanced by use of small-format detectors with pixels that do not fully sample the diffraction limit. Using an object-independent phase-diversity algorithm, we show that, for both pointlike and extended objects, the fidelity of the phase and amplitude estimates degrades gracefully, rather than catastrophically, as the sampling becomes coarser. We show in simulation that the same algorithm also improves the fidelity of image reconstruction of complex targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Xenopus Cadherin-11 (Xcad-11) is expressed when cranial neural crest cells (CNC) acquire motility. However, its function in stimulating cell migration is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xcad-11 initiates filopodia and lamellipodia formation, which is essential for CNC to populate pharyngeal pouches. We identified the cytoplasmic tail of Xcad-11 as both necessary and sufficient for proper CNC migration as long as it was linked to the plasma membrane. Our results showing that guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-Trio binds to Xcad-11 and can functionally substitute for it like constitutively active forms of RhoA, Rac, and cdc42 unravel a novel cadherin function.},

Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides “digital embryos,” that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource.},

  Abstract                 = {Although it is rarely considered so in modern developmental biology, morphogenesis is fundamentally a biomechanical process, and this is especially true of one of the first major morphogenic transformations in development, gastrulation. Cells bring about changes in embryonic form by generating patterned forces and by differentiating the tissue mechanical properties that harness these forces in specific ways. Therefore, biomechanics lies at the core of connecting the genetic and molecular basis of cell activities to the macroscopic tissue deformations that shape the embryo. Here we discuss what is known of the biomechanics of gastrulation, primarily in amphibians but also comparing similar morphogenic processes in teleost fish and amniotes, and selected events in several species invertebrates. Our goal is to review what is known and identify problems for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {Microimaging techniques with synchrotron radiation demand fast, on-line x-ray detectors with a spatial resolution in the micrometer or submicrometer range. For this task an x-ray detector based on a transparent, i.e., nonscattering, luminescent screen has been developed. Its performance is described experimentally and theoretically. The detector consists of an Y3Al5O12:Ce screen, microscope optics, and a low-noise CCD camera, operated at x-ray energies between 10 and 50 keV. Good image quality is achieved if the depth of focus of the optical system is matched to the x-ray absorption length or thickness of the scintillator. A spatial resolution of 0.8 $\mu$m fwhm (1000 line pairs/mm with 10\% contrast) was measured by recording the interferogram of a boron fiber. First applications in phase contrast imaging and microtomography are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {The cellular stress response is a universal mechanism of extraordinary physiological/pathophysiological significance. It represents a defense reaction of cells to damage that environmental forces inflict on macromolecules. Many aspects of the cellular stress response are not stressor specific because cells monitor stress based on macromolecular damage without regard to the type of stress that causes such damage. Cellular mechanisms activated by DNA damage and protein damage are interconnected and share common elements. Other cellular responses directed at re-establishing homeostasis are stressor specific and often activated in parallel to the cellular stress response. All organisms have stress proteins, and universally conserved stress proteins can be regarded as the minimal stress proteome. Functional analysis of the minimal stress proteome yields information about key aspects of the cellular stress response, including physiological mechanisms of sensing membrane lipid, protein, and DNA damage; redox sensing and regulation; cell cycle control; macromolecular stabilization/repair; and control of energy metabolism. In addition, cells can quantify stress and activate a death program (apoptosis) when tolerance limits are exceeded.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new prior for phase retrieval from X-ray Fresnel diffraction patterns. Fresnel diffraction patterns are achieved by letting a highly coherent X-ray beam propagate in free space after interaction with an object. Previously, either homogeneous or multi-material object assumptions have been used. The advantage of the homogeneous object assumption is that the prior can be introduced in the Radon domain. Heterogeneous object priors, on the other hand, have to be applied in the object domain. Here, we let the relationship between attenuation and refractive index vary as a function of the measured attenuation index. The method is evaluated using images acquired at beamline ID19 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) of a phantom where the prior is calculated by linear interpolation and of a healing bone obtained from a rat osteotomy model. It is shown that the ratio between attenuation and refractive index in bone for different levels of mineralization follows a power law. Reconstruction was performed using the mixed approach but is compatible with other, more advanced models. We achieve more precise reconstructions than previously reported in literature. We believe that the proposed method will find application in biomedical imaging problems where the object is strongly heterogeneous, such as bone healing and biomaterials engineering.},

The main themes highlighted will be; (a) why synchrotron radiation is necessary for structural studies on biological macromolecules, (b) examples of experimental stations used for protein crystallography at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, \{SERC\} Daresbury Laboratory, (c) how the wavelength tunability can be exploited to solve the “phase problem”, (d) structural studies with the “white beam”, (e) high resolution data using cryogenic methods and (f) studies on large structures. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a method and an equipment for performing μm-resolved X-ray diffraction area maps, and apply it to wafer defect analysis and industrial wafer quality inspection. The method determines simultaneously the macroscopic warpage, the mesoscopic curvature and the microscopic defect structure of semiconductor wagers. It is based on X-ray diffraction rocking curve imaging of the whole wafer with down to 1 μm2 resolution. The new wafer testing equipment determines the maximal and integral peak intensities, the peak position and the half width of the rocking curves with a microscopic resolution, thus imaging simultaneously the macroscopic quality parameters and the microscopic defect structure. This permits to establish a direct one-to-one correlation between the microscopic defects and the resulting macroscopic effects. As an example, wafers of different materials, fabrication technology and resulting perfection are studied. When investigating layered samples, the technique allows furthermore to determine the influence of the wafer quality on the layer properties. The method can be applied generally to characterize non-destructively the quality of all kinds of crystalline structures, like, e.g. microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. },

  Abstract                 = {X-ray detector systems are powerful tools: in combination with tomographic methods they provide volumetric data of samples in a non-destructive manner which is of high interest for, e.g., biology, medicine or materials research. The detector able to provide images with submicrometer spatial resolution frequently consists of a scintillator screen, light microscopy optics and a digital camera. Here, the scintillator converts the X-rays into a visible light image which is projected onto the camera by the light optics. In order to perform high resolution imaging Single Crystal Film (SCF) scintillators 1 mum to 30 mum thin are required due to the limited depth of focus of the microscopy optics. Thin SCFs can be obtained via liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). A drawback is that a detector working with SCFs suffers from low efficiency (2\% at 50 keV) owing to their limited thickness. The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) is here mainly limited by the low absorption of X-rays and the light yield in the thin scintillator layer. Performances, i.e absorption, light yield, afterglow of operational systems at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) using YAG:Ce (Y3Al5O12:Ce), LAG:Eu (Lu3Al5O12:Eu) and GGG:Eu (Gd3Ga5O12:Eu) scintillators will be presented and compared to new LSO:Tb (Lu2SiO5:Tb) scintillators developed in the framework of an European project , . A new concept to improve the efficiency of detection in the 20 keV - 40 keV energy range with 1 mum spatial resolution will be presented. This concept based on multilayer scintillators is realised by the LPE process as well. First results will be illustrated with X-ray images and will demonstrate the absorption efficiency improvement of the X-ray detector. The expected performance is 7 times better than the LAG-based scintillators.},

  Abstract                 = {First Talbot interferometry in the hard X-ray region was demonstrated using a pair of transmission gratings made by forming gold stripes on glass plates. By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of X-rays with a separation that caused the Talbot effect by the first grating, moiré fringes were produced inclining one grating slightly against the other around the optical axis. A phase object placed in front of the first grating was detected by moiré-fringe bending. Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured. This result suggests that X-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive X-ray radiography.},

  Abstract                 = {Considering a pure and not necessarily weak phase object, we review a noniterative and nonlinear single-distance phase-retrieval algorithm. The latter exploits the fact that a well-known linear contrast-transfer function, which incorporates all orders in object-detector distance, can be modified to yield a quasiparticle dispersion. Accepting a small loss of information, this algorithm also retrieves the high-frequency parts of the phase in an artefact free way. We point out an extension of this highly resolving quasiparticle approach for mixed objects by assuming a global attenuation-phase duality. Tomographically reconstructing two developmental stages in Xenopus laevis, we compare our approach with a linear algorithm, based on the transport-of-intensity equation, which suppresses high-frequency information.},

Here we provide a detailed protocol for applying this technique to study gastrulation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) embryos. In contrast to Î¼MRI, XPCÎ¼T images optically opaque embryos with subminute temporal and micrometer-range spatial resolution. We describe sample preparation, culture and suspension of embryos, tomographic imaging with a typical duration of 2 h (gastrulation and neurulation stages), intricacies of image pre-processing, phase retrieval, tomographic reconstruction, segmentation and motion analysis. Moreover, we briefly discuss our present understanding of X-ray dose effects (heat load and radiolysis), and we outline how to optimize the experimental configuration with respect to X-ray energy, photon flux density, sample-detector distance, exposure time per tomographic projection, numbers of projections and time-lapse intervals. The protocol requires an interdisciplinary effort of developmental biologists for sample preparation and data interpretation, X-ray physicists for planning and performing the experiment and applied mathematicians/computer scientists/physicists for data processing and analysis. Sample preparation requires 9â48 h, depending on the stage of development to be studied. Data acquisition takes 2â3 h per tomographic time-lapse sequence.

  Abstract                 = {A new double-grating-based phase-contrast imaging technique is described. This technique differs from the conventional double-grating imaging method by the image acquisition strategy. The novelty of the proposed method is in lateral scanning of both gratings simultaneously while an image is collected. The collected image is not contaminated by a Moir\'{e} pattern and can be recorded even by using a high-spatial-resolution integrating detector (e.g. X-ray film), thus facilitating improved resolution and/or contrast in the image. A detailed theoretical analysis of image formation in the scanning-double-grating method is carried out within the rigorous wave-optical formalism. The transfer function for the scanning-double-grating imaging system is derived. An approximate geometricaloptics solution for the image intensity distribution is derived from the exact wave-optical formula using the stationary-phase approach. Based on the present formalism, the effects of finite source size on the preferred operating conditions and of polychromaticity on the image contrast and resolution are investigated.},

  Abstract                 = { X-ray sources are developing rapidly and their coherent output is growing correspondingly. The increased coherent flux from modern X-ray sources is being matched with an associated development in experimental methods. This article reviews the literature describing the ideas that utilize the increased brilliance from modern X-ray sources. It explores how ideas in coherent X-ray science are leading to developments in other areas, and vice versa. The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this discussion as a base from which to describe partially coherent diffraction and X-ray phase-contrast imaging, with applications in materials science, engineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron lasers are briefly discussed. The literature on X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy is described and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is presented. },

  Abstract                 = {The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCi) overcomes the main limitation of absorption-based x-ray imaging i.e. poor image contrast due to small absorption differences, and was proven capable to produce high contrast images of objects invisible to conventional methods. The problem so far was that XPCi was only feasible with synchrotron radiation sources (SR), which prevented any application of the technique outside the research domain. XPCi images can be produced outside SR only by means of microfocal sources, which result in dramatically increased exposure times. XPCi images with conventional sources were also obtained by means of a grating (or shearing) interferometer, but this still requires the source to be spatially coherent unless an absorption grid is placed in close contact with the source itself. By doing this, the output of the source is dramatically reduced, resulting in exposure times only marginally improved over those obtained with microfocal sources. We have developed a new technique, based on coded apertures, which overcomes all the above limitations and allows intense XPCi signals to be achieved with source sizes fully compatible with current state-of-the-art X-ray sources, without requiring any filtering/focusing/grating element to be placed in contact with the source thus suppressing its output. A pre-sample coded aperture system with a fill factor of 0.5 is used instead, which means that the increase in exposure time over conventional methods is only of a factor of 2. The technique was fully modelled and a proof-of-concept experiment carried out. The obtained results are in full agreement with the model, and demonstrate that image contrast increases comparable to those obtained with SR can be achieved with a focal spot of 100 micron. A larger scale imaging prototype aimed at homeland security is currently under development, and future applications aimed at medical, scientific and industrial imaging are currently being studied.},

Here, we report on the use of microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to directly follow morphogenetic movements during blastula and gastrula stages of the Xenopus laevis embryo. We compare three different MRI modalities that take advantage of the intrinsic contrast present in embryonic tissues: three-dimensional (3D) fat-imaging, 3D water-imaging, and 2D high-speed high-resolution imaging of early embryonic stages. We show that the features revealed by the intrinsic contrast correlate with the histological structure of the embryo. Using this tissue specific intrinsic contrast, the main embryonic tissues and internal tissue movements as well as archenteron invagination can be differentiated without cell labeling. We present 2D and 3D time-lapse sequences of early Xenopus embryonic development, spanning the stages from early blastula to the end of gastrula, which show the complex internal rearrangements of gastrulation in essentially real-time.

  Abstract                 = {The dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) of the amphibian embryo is a key embryonic region involved in body axis organization and neural induction. Using time-lapse microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we follow the pregastrula movements that lead to the formation of the \{DMZ\} of the stage 10 Xenopus embryo. 2D and 3D \{MRI\} time-lapse series reveal that pregastrular movements change the tissue architecture of the \{DMZ\} at earlier stages and in a different fashion than previously appreciated. Beginning at stage 9, epiboly of the animal cap moves tissue into the dorsal but not into the ventral marginal zone, resulting in an asymmetry between the dorsal and the ventral sides. Time-lapse imaging of labeled blastomeres shows that the animal cap tissue moves into the superficial \{DMZ\} overlying the deeper mesendoderm of the DMZ. The shearing of superficial tissue over the deeper mesendoderm creates the radial/vertical arrangement of ectoderm outside of mesendoderm within the DMZ, which is independent of involution and prior to the formation of the dorsal blastoporal lip. This tilting of the \{DMZ\} is distinct from, but occurs synchronously with, the vegetal rotation of the vegetal cell mass [R., Winklbauer, M., Schürfeld (1999). “Vegetal rotation, a new gastrulation movement involved in the internalization of the mesoderm and endoderm in Xenopus.” Development. 126, 3703–3713.].

  Abstract                 = {Mitotic cell division is a highly regulated cellular event in all organisms, but its direct visualization in the vertebrates is limited to animals with transparent embryos. Here, we report on the use of microscopic magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) to noninvasively observe mitotic cell division of early blastomeres in the optically opaque Xenopus laevis embryo. Due to intrinsic tissue contrast, cell nuclei can be directly visualized without the need for contrast enhancing labeling. By taking two-dimensional in vivo time-lapse image sequences, the karyokinesis of a blastomere is followed. Timing and orientation of the cleavages can be traced for five cell divisions to establish a cell lineage tree, including orientation and timing of the mitosis. This work demonstrates for the first time the use of MRI for the visualization of cell divisions and expands the experimental scope of the Xenopus embryo.

A theory of Fresnel diffraction and Fourier optics results, involving merely coordinate transformations of the independent variables of the aperture ambiguity function. As an application, a simple expression for the width of the diffracted beam is derived in terms of certain moments of the amplitude of the incident wave. The analysis is extended to signals crossing a layer of a random medium. At the exit plane, the field is partially coherent and it spreads as it propagates. The broadening of beam width due to the loss in coherence is related to the statistical properties of the layer.},

Advanced algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge can sometimes produce accurate reconstructions, but they typically require long computation times. Furthermore, the required prior knowledge can be very specific, limiting the type of images that can be reconstructed. Here, we present a reconstruction method that automatically learns prior knowledge using an artificial neural network. We show that this method can be viewed as a combination of filtered backprojection steps, and, therefore, has a relatively low computational cost. Results for two different cases show that the new method is able to use the learned information to produce high quality reconstructions in a short time, even when presented with a small number of projections.},

  Abstract                 = {An iterative Bayesian reconstruction algorithm for limited view angle tomography, or ectomography, based on the three-dimensional total variation (TV) norm has been developed. The TV norm has been described in the literature as a method for reducing noise in two-dimensional images while preserving edges, without introducing ringing or edge artefacts. It has also been proposed as a 2D regularization function in Bayesian reconstruction, implemented in an expectation maximization algorithm (TV-EM). The TV-EM was developed for 2D single photon emission computed tomography imaging, and the algorithm is capable of smoothing noise while maintaining edges without introducing artefacts. The TV norm was extended from 2D to 3D and incorporated into an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm for limited view angle geometry. The algorithm, called TV3D-EM, was evaluated using a modelled point spread function and digital phantoms. Reconstructed images were compared with those reconstructed with the 2D filtered backprojection algorithm currently used in ectomography. Results show a substantial reduction in artefacts related to the limited view angle geometry, and noise levels were also improved. Perhaps most important, depth resolution was improved by at least 45%. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm has been shown to improve the perceived image quality.},

  Abstract                 = {When one integrates a function of two variables x,y - a point function f(P) in the plane - subject to suitable regularity conditions along an arbitrary straight line g then one obtains in the integral values F(g), a line function. In Part A of the present paper the problem which is solved is the inversion of this linear functional transformation, that is the following questions are answered: can every line function satisfying suitable regularity conditions be regarded as constructed in this way? If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces. The treatment of these problems, themselves of interest, gains enhanced importance through the numerous relationships that exist between this topic and the theory of logarithmic and Newtonian potentials. These are mentioned at appropriate places in the text.},

  Abstract                 = {The cellular mechanisms underlying organ formation are largely unknown. We visualized early vertebrate eye morphogenesis at single-cell resolution by in vivo imaging in medaka (Oryzias latipes). Before optic vesicle evagination, retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) modulate their convergence in a fate-specific manner. Presumptive forebrain cells converge toward the midline, whereas medial RPCs remain stationary, predetermining the site of evagination. Subsequent optic vesicle evagination is driven by the active migration of individual RPCs. The analysis of mutants demonstrated that the retina-specific transcription factor rx3 determines the convergence and migration behaviors of RPCs. Hence, the migration of individual cells mediates essential steps of organ morphogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {This book is a modern introduction to the ideas and techniques of quantum field theory. After a brief overview of particle physics and a survey of relativistic wave equations and Lagrangian methods, the author develops the quantum theory of scalar and spinor fields, and then of gauge fields. The emphasis throughout is on functional methods, which have played a large part in modern field theory. The book concludes with a brief survey of "topological" objects in field theory and, new to this edition, a chapter devoted to supersymmetry. Graduate students in particle physics and high energy physics will benefit from this book.},

Many of the programs calculate radiation from undulators and wigglers, but others, such as X-ray tube codes, are also available. The computation of the index of refraction and attenuation coefficients of optical elements using user-selectable databases containing optical constants is an important part of the package for calculation of beam propagation. Coupled computations are thus feasible where the output from one program serves as the input to another program. Recent developments including enhancements to existing programs are described.},

  Abstract                 = {Often detector resolution limits the spatial resolution of x-ray imaging close to 1 μm. Image magnification is one of the solutions of this problem. Among several approaches magnification by asymmetric Bragg reflection is a promising way to achieve magnification around or above a factor of 100. This technique is well known for many years but not yet established. Therefore this paper will discuss the implications regarding experimental set-up, resolution and efficiency. This will be done mainly from the experimental point of view by means of experiments which were done at the beamline ID11 of the European synchrotron radiation facility. It is shown that submicrometre resolution can be achieved at high magnification in two dimensions. This even holds in case of objects with low contrast. The technique is well suited for an energy range around 10 keV at highly brilliant sources. Some effects related with beam optics, Fresnel and Bragg reflection are observed, which might be critical for further image evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {The future demands of computed tomography imaging regarding the x-ray source can be summarized with higher scan power, shorter rotation times, shorter cool down times and smaller focal spots. We report on a new tube technology satisfying all these demands by making use of a novel cooling principle on one hand and of a novel beam control system on the other hand. Nowadays tubes use a rotating anode disk mainly cooled via radiation. The Straton x-ray tube is the first tube available for clinical routine utilizing convective cooling exclusively. It is demonstrated that this cooling principle makes large heat storage capacities of the anode disk obsolete. The unprecedented cooling rate of 4.8 MHU/min eliminates the need for waiting times due to anode cooling in clinical workflow. Moreover, an electronic beam deflection system for focal spot position and size control opens the door to advanced applications. The physical backgrounds are discussed and the technical realization is presented. From this discussion the superior suitability of this tube to withstand g-forces well above 20 g created by fast rotating gantries will become evident. Experience from a large clinical trial is reported and possible ways for future developments are discussed.},

The entrance to the mRNA channel will encircle the message when a latch-like contact closes and contributes to processivity and fidelity. Extended \{RNA\} helical elements that run longitudinally through the body transmit structural changes, correlating events at the particle's far end with the cycle of mRNA translocation at the decoding region. 96\% of the nucleotides were traced and the main fold of all proteins was determined. The latter are either peripheral or appear to serve as linkers. Some may assist the directionality of translocation.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two "function spaces," and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maxmum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of "ideal" systems which transmit at this maxmum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.},

It fills an imaging gap between MRI and confocal microscopy, being most suited to specimens that are from 1 to 10 mm across. The tomographic principles of optical projection tomography (OPT) are explained, its most important applications in biomedical research explored, and comparisons drawn of its pros and cons compared to a number of alternative imaging technologies. },

  Abstract                 = {Current techniques for three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopy (deconvolution, confocal microscopy, and optical coherence tomography) generate 3D data by “optically sectioning” the specimen. This places severe constraints on the maximum thickness of a specimen that can be imaged. We have developed a microscopy technique that uses optical projection tomography (OPT) to produce high-resolution 3D images of both fluorescent and nonfluorescent biological specimens with a thickness of up to 15 millimeters. OPT microscopy allows the rapid mapping of the tissue distribution of RNA and protein expression in intact embryos or organ systems and can therefore be instrumental in studies of developmental biology or gene function.},

Removing or at least significantly reducing such artefacts is indispensable. However, since micro-CT systems are pushed to the extremes in the quest for the ultimate spatial resolution, ring artefacts can hardly be avoided. Moreover, as opposed to clinical CT systems, conventional correction schemes such as flat-field correction do not lead to satisfactory results. Therefore, in this note a simple but efficient and fast post processing method is proposed that effectively reduces ring artefacts in reconstructed μ-CT images.},

  Abstract                 = {Near-micrometer resolution, three-dimensional computed tomographic images were made of a test object using the hard x-ray microscope developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The microscope uses a cooled CCD camera with direct conversion of the incident x rays by a 512 multiplied by 512 chip with 19 micrometer by 19 micrometer cells. Magnification by a factor of 20 is achieved using asymmetric Bragg diffraction from a pair of silicon crystals. The imaging system is designed for samples of the order of 0.50 mm diameter by 0.50 mm height. From beamline X23A3 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) 8.17 keV x rays were used. Two hundred, 512 multiplied by 512 two-dimensional projections were collected every 0.9 degrees about the test object using the NIST microscope. The projections were digitized and sent to a computer for volume tomographic reconstruction by a parallel-beam, convolution-backprojection algorithm into a 5123 image with (1 micrometer)3 voxels. The test object consisted of glass and nickel microspheres with distributions from about 4 t 40 micrometer (glass) or to 24 micrometer (nickel) diameters suspended in epoxy in order to demonstrate near one micrometer resolution in all three dimensions and probe contrast sensitivity. The effect and interplay of photon statistics and energy, and sample composition, density and size on tomographic performance are discussed as are resolution limitations and image artifacts from Fresnel diffraction.},

  Abstract                 = {A personal recollection of the development of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) into a structure-determination technique is presented. Because of confusion in the theoretical explanation of the `Kronig structure', now called EXAFS, the extended XAFS, its explanation remained unresolved for about 40 years. As I was introduced to the EXAFS phenomenon by Farrel Lytle and saw his impressive data, the thought came to me that scattering of the photoelectron from surrounding atoms could be the mechanism of the effect. My graduate student, Dale Sayers, agreed to work on developing the theory under my supervision and to make EXAFS measurements under Lytle's supervision as his PhD thesis. The theory led to the idea of a Fourier transform of the EXAFS, which showed peaks from surrounding atoms, proving the validity of the theory and suggesting the method of structure determination by using standards from known structures. Within a few years, facilities at synchrotron sources were developed to measure XAFS, opening up the technique to the general scientific community. In spite of some initial growing pains, XAFS has matured into a powerful technique for local structure and has been applied to obtain magnetic structure, in addition to distribution of atoms. Other related techniques have been spawned from XAFS, expanding the impact of the original phenomenon.},

  Abstract                 = {In transmission microscopy, many objects are three dimensional, that is, they are thicker than the depth of focus of the imaging system. The three-dimensional (3-D) image-intensity distribution consists of a series of two-dimensional images (optical slices) with different parts of the object in focus. First, we deal with the fundamental limitations of 3-D imaging with classical optical systems. Second, a transfer theory of 3-D image formation is derived that relates the 3-D object (complex index of refraction) to the 3-D image intensity distribution in first-order Born approximation. This theory applies to weak objects that do not scatter much light. Since, in a microscope, the illumination is neither coherent nor completely incoherent, a theory for partially coherent light is needed, but in this case the object phase distribution and the absorptive parts of the object play different roles. Finally, some experimental results are presented.},

The concept of analytic pupil function is introduced, and for such pupil functions it is shown that any finite-order irradiance moment exists, even in the presence of arbitrary continuous phase aberrations. The uniqueness of the relationship between pupil-plane phase and irradiance moments, when the moments are calculated over an orthogonal plane at a fixed point along the optical axis in image space, is obscure, and the relationship between phase and moments is generally nonlinear. However, by studying the behavior of irradiance moments throughout the neighborhood of a given axial point in image space, one may determine, for a large class of pupils, the pupil-plane phase uniquely (within an arbitrary additive constant), and only a linear problem need be solved for phase retrieval. In particular, unique phase retrieval may be accomplished by measuring moments in the neighborhood of either the pupil plane or the image plane. Examples of this technique are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemical genetics uses small molecules to modulate protein function and, in principle, has the potential to perturb any biochemical event in a complex cellular context. The application of chemical genetics to dissect biological processes has become an attractive alternative to mutagenesis screens due to its technical simplicity, inexpensive reagents, and low-startup costs. In vertebrates, only fish and amphibians are amenable to chemical genetic screens. Xenopus frogs share a long evolutionary history with mammals and so represent an excellent model to predict human biology. In this review, we discuss the lessons learned from chemical genetic studies carried out in zebrafish and Xenopus. We highlight how Xenopus can be employed as a convenient first-line animal model at various stages of the drug discovery and development process and comment on how they represent much-needed tools to bridge the gap between traditional in vitro and preclinical mammalian assays in biomedical research and drug development.

  Abstract                 = {The modern formulation of the renormalization group is explained for both critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The expansion in Ïµ = 4âd is explained [d is the dimension of space (statistical mechanics) or space-time (quantum field theory)]. The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1â8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6â8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feyman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10â13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10; sections 11â13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory. An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions. },

We show that in Xenopus, an active distortion of the vegetal cell mass, vegetal rotation, leads to a dramatic expansion of the blastocoel floor and a concomitant turning around of the marginal zone which constitutes the first and major step of mesoderm involution. This vigorous inward surging of the vegetal region into the blastocoel can be analyzed in explanted slices of the gastrula, and is apparently driven by cell rearrangement. Thus, the prospective endoderm, previously thought to be moved passively, provides the main driving force for the internalization of the mesendoderm during the first half of gastrulation. For further involution, and for normal positioning of the involuted mesoderm and its rapid advance toward the animal pole, fibronectin-independent interaction with the blastocoel roof is required.},

  Abstract                 = { High energy, α, β and γ-radiation from nuclear fission and neutron activation products interacts with water by initially ionizing it. The ionized or excited water molecule undergoes a series of energy transfer processes, and decomposes into both oxidizing and reducing species, •OH, H2O2, O2, H2, •H, •O2 – and •eaq –, whose relative concentrations change considerably within a short time scale following the initial interaction. Under long-term continuous irradiation these species reach low, steady-state concentrations that can dictate the aqueous redox potential and, hence, materials corrosion processes. Understanding the impact of radiolysis is an important factor in the design, analysis and maintenance of materials in environments such as nuclear power plant coolant systems where high levels of radiation are present. Chemical additives may be used to effectively push the environment toward an optimal redox state to protect reactor components, but determination of the appropriate additive levels must take into account the influence of radiolysis on the system chemistry. The effects of chemical additives (pH-controlling agents, dissolved gases (O2 and H2) and dissolved corrosion products) on steady-state radiolysis chemistry have been investigated by both experiments and kinetic model analysis under long-term continuous irradiation conditions. The studies show there are three distinct regions of water radiolysis behaviour: pH < 4.5; 4.5 < pH < 9.7; and pH > 9.7 with the relative levels of radical and molecular radiolysis products changing substantially from one region to another. These studies show how changes in the concentrations of key species that react with water radiolysis products influence the eventual steady-state concentrations by changing the rates of some reactions. Additives or dissolved species that can induce significant changes in the steady-state concentrations are those that can react with water radiolysis products in a catalytic manner. },

A phase-retrieval approach based on the phase-attenuation duality with high energy x-rays can greatly facilitate for phase sensitive imaging by allowing phase retrieval from only one single projection image. The previously derived phase retrieval formula is valid only for small Fresnel propagator phases corresponding to common clinical imaging tasks. In this work we presented a new duality-based phase retrieval formula that can be applied for cases with large Fresnel propagator phases corresponding to high spatial resolution imaging. The computer simulation demonstrated superiority of this new formula over the previous phase retrieval formula in reconstructing the high frequency components of imaged objects. A modified Tikhonov regularization technique has been devised for phase retrieval in cases of very high resolution and large object-detector distance such that some Fresnel propagator phases may be close or greater than $\pi$. This new phase retrieval formula lays the foundation for implementing high-resolution phase-sensitive 3D imaging of soft tissue objects.},

  Abstract                 = {Although diagnostic medical imaging provides enormous benefits in the early detection and accuracy diagnosis of various diseases, there are growing concerns on the potential side effect of radiation induced genetic, cancerous and other diseases. How to reduce radiation dose while maintaining the diagnostic performance is a major challenge in the computed tomography (CT) field. Inspired by the compressive sensing theory, the sparse constraint in terms of total variation (TV) minimization has already led to promising results for low-dose CT reconstruction. Compared to the discrete gradient transform used in the TV method, dictionary learning is proven to be an effective way for sparse representation. On the other hand, it is important to consider the statistical property of projection data in the low-dose CT case. Recently, we have developed a dictionary learning based approach for low-dose X-ray CT. In this paper, we present this method in detail and evaluate it in experiments. In our method, the sparse constraint in terms of a redundant dictionary is incorporated into an objective function in a statistical iterative reconstruction framework. The dictionary can be either predetermined before an image reconstruction task or adaptively defined during the reconstruction process. An alternating minimization scheme is developed to minimize the objective function. Our approach is evaluated with low-dose X-ray projections collected in animal and human CT studies, and the improvement associated with dictionary learning is quantified relative to filtered backprojection and TV-based reconstructions. The results show that the proposed approach might produce better images with lower noise and more detailed structural features in our selected cases. However, there is no proof that this is true for all kinds of structures.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of soft tissues requires the solution of two inverse problems: phase retrieval and the reconstruction of the 3D image from a tomographic stack of two-dimensional (2D) projections. The number of projections per stack should be small to accommodate fast tomography of rapid processes and to constrain X-ray radiation dose to optimal levels to either increase the duration of in vivo time-lapse series at a given goal for spatial resolution and/or the conservation of structure under X-ray irradiation. In pursuing the 3D reconstruction problem in the sense of compressive sampling theory, we propose to reduce the number of projections by applying an advanced algebraic technique subject to the minimisation of the total variation (TV) in the reconstructed slice. This problem is formulated in a Lagrangian multiplier fashion with the parameter value determined by appealing to a discrete L-curve in conjunction with a conjugate gradient method. The usefulness of this reconstruction modality is demonstrated for simulated and in vivo data, the latter acquired in parallel-beam imaging experiments using synchrotron radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a novel iterative reconstruction (IR) method coupled with dual-dictionary learning (DDL) for image reconstruction in a dedicated breast computed tomography (CT) system based on a cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) photon-counting detector and compared it to the filtered-back-projection (FBP) method with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of projections necessary for reconstruction without sacrificing the image quality. Postmortem breast samples were scanned in a fan-beam CT system and were reconstructed from 100 to 600 projections with both IR and FBP methods. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between the glandular and adipose tissues of the postmortem breast samples was calculated to compare the quality of images reconstructed from IR and FBP. The spatial resolution of the two reconstruction techniques was evaluated using aluminum (Al) wires with diameters of 643, 813, 1020, 1290 and 1630 µm in a plastic epoxy resin phantom with a diameter of 13 cm. Both the spatial resolution and the CNR were improved with IR compared to FBP for the images reconstructed from the same number of projections. In comparison with FBP reconstruction, the CNR was improved from 3.4 to 7.5 by using the IR method with six-fold fewer projections while maintaining the same spatial resolution. The study demonstrated that the IR method coupled with DDL could significantly reduce the required number of projections for a CT reconstruction compared to the FBP method while achieving a much better CNR and maintaining the same spatial resolution. From this, the radiation dose and scanning time can potentially be reduced by a factor of approximately 6 by using this IR method for image reconstruction in a CZT-based breast CT system.},

  Abstract                 = {Several existing strategies for estimating the axial intensity derivative in the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) from multiple intensity measurements have been unified by the Savitzky-Golay differentiation filter - an equivalent convolution solution for differentiation estimation by least-squares polynomial fitting. The different viewpoint from the digital filter in signal processing not only provides great insight into the behaviors, the shortcomings, and the performance of these existing intensity derivative estimation algorithms, but more important, it also suggests a new way of improving solution strategies by extending the applications of Savitzky-Golay differentiation filter in TIE. Two novel methods for phase retrieval based on TIE are presented - the first by introducing adaptive-degree strategy in spatial domain and the second by selecting optimal spatial frequencies in Fourier domain. Numerical simulations and experiments verify that the second method outperforms the existing methods significantly, showing reliable retrieved phase with both overall contrast and fine phase variations well preserved.},
